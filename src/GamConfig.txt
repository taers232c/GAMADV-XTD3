GAM versions 4.00 and above use a configuration file, gam.cfg, to store the values of the various environment variables
and signal files used by earlier versions of GAM. Configuration files client_secrets.json, oauth2.txt, oauth2service.json and extra_args.txt
are moved to a version independent location. This should simplify upgrading GAM versions in the future.
Additionally, if you support multiple clients/domains or have multiple users running GAM,
gam.cfg lets you easily manage your configuration.

In the following discussion, these names will be used to refer to directories:
* OldGamPath: Location of previous version of gam.py or gam.exe
* GamPath: Location of new version of gam.py or gam.exe
* GamCfgDir: Location of gam.cfg
* GamConfigDir: Location of client_secrets.json, oauth2.txt, oauth2service.json, extra_args.txt
* GamCacheDir: Google API cache files
* GamDriveDir: Files downloaded with gam user <User> get drivefile <DriveFileID> when targetfolder <FilePath> is not specified
* GamSiteDir: Location of admin-settings-v2.json, cloudprint-v2.json, contacts-v3.json, email-audit-v1.json, email-settings-v2.json

In versions of GAM before 4.00, the following locations are used:
* GamCfgDir: Not used
* GamConfigDir: GamPath
* GamCacheDir: 	GamPath/gamcache
* GamDriveDir: 	GamPath

In GAM 3.70 and above, a new scheme for locating files is implemented.
These are the default values that GAM uses.
* GamCfgDir: ~/.gam
* GamConfigDir: ~/.gam
* GamCacheDir: ~/.gam/gamcache
* GamDriveDir: ~/Downloads

If you are an existing GAM user and don't like the suggested locations or you already have some other scheme in use,
set GAMCFGDIR to the desired path for gam.cfg. In gam.cfg, specify the desired values for the other locations.

How will gam.cfg be used? At its simplest, it is created once and you can ignore it.
Every once in a while, you edit gam.cfg to set some desired values and then you ignore it.
gam.cfg must be a plain text file, you can edit it with your favorite text editor (emacs, vi, TextWrangler,
TextEdit, Notepad, Wordpad) as long as you wind up with a plain text file.

If you are upgrading from a previous version of GAM, set the environment variable OLDGAMPATH to OldGamPath. This is a one-time setting
to allow GAM to find your old signal files and to copy client_secrets.json, oauth2.txt, oauth2service.json, extra_args.txt
from OldGamPath to GamConfigDir. To generate the initial gam.cfg, execute the command: gam select default verify.
Once gam.cfg is created, no signal files are read and the only environment variable used is GAMCFGDIR.
GAMFIGDIR does not have to be set unless you want a value other than ~/.gam for the location of gam.cfg.

These are the gam.cfg variables; if GAM does not find a value for an environment variable, the default value is used.
If a signal file is located, the associated variable is set True, otherwise False.
(For debug.gam, debug_level is set to 4 if the file is located, otherwise 0.)

If you (the administrator) run GAM and have multiple other users that also run GAM, you will make a gam.cfg for each user.
To generate the initial gam.cfg for a user, log on as that user and execute the command: gam select default verify.
This will create a gam.cfg for the user using the environment variables specific to the user. For efficiency, you
may want to edit each users gam.cfg and set "no_update_check = true" so that GAM update checks are performed only by you.
You might set the permissions on each users gam.cfg to be read-only so that they can't make unauthorized changes.

There are three new arguments to GAM that should simplify how you use GAM with multiple clients/domains.
Each client/domain will have a section in gam.cfg that sets the values specific to it.
The select argument specifies the section of gam.cfg to use for processing the rest of the GAM command;
it's how you quickly switch from from one client to another.

The arguments are optional, must appear in this order and must be the first arguments before any other GAM arguments.

select <Section> [save] [verify]
	Use <Section> from gam.cfg for the current GAM command.
	<Section> is case-sensitive except for DEFAULT which is case-insensitive.
    save
	Set section = <Section> in the DEFAULT section of gam.cfg
	Write configuration data to gam.cfg
    verify
	Print the variable values for the current section
	Values are determined in this order: Current section, DEFAULT section, Program default

The config argument is used to set selected variables in gam.cfg via the command line.

config [<VariableName> [=] <Value>]* [save] [verify]
    <VariableName> [=] <Value>
	Set <VariableName> = <Value> in the current section
	All <VariableNames> except section are allowed.
	The = is optional but must be surrounded by spaces if included.
    save
	Write configuration data to gam.cfg
    verify
	Print the variable values for the current section
	Values are determined in this order: Current section, DEFAULT section, Program default

redirect csv <FileName> [multiprocess] [append] [noheader] [charset <Charset>] [columndelimiter <Character>]
	If the pattern {{Section}} appears in <FileName>, it will be replaced with the name of the current section.
	If <FileName> is relative, it is appended to drive_dir in the current section if defined or drive_dir in DEFAULT
	If the GAM command writes a CSV file, it will be written to <FileName> rather than stdout
redirect stdout <FileName> [append]
	If the pattern {{Section}} appears in <FileName>, it will be replaced with the name of the current section.
	If <FileName> is relative, it is appended to drive_dir in the current section if defined or drive_dir in DEFAULT
	GAM output to stdout will be written to <FileName>
redirect stderr <FileName> [append]
	If the pattern {{Section}} appears in <FileName>, it will be replaced with the name of the current section.
	If <FileName> is relative, it is appended to drive_dir in the current section if defined or drive_dir in DEFAULT
	GAM output to stderr will be written to <FileName>

Here is a sample multiple domain/client example.
You have five clients: main, foo, goo, shared1 and shared2; 90% of your work is with client main.

* Clients main, foo and goo have distinct oauth2service.json and client_secrets.json files.
* Clients shared1 and shared2 have shared oauth2service.json and client_secrets.json files.
* All clients have distinct oauth2.txt files.
* The files for foo, goo, shared1 and shared2 have prefixes to indicate the client; the main files do not have prefixes.
* All files are in OldGamPath. You have been using the environment variables CLIENTSECRETS, OAUTHFILE and OAUTHSERVICEFILE
to specify the client on which to operate. You have:
    - client_secrets.json, oauth2.txt, oauth2service.json
    - foo_client_secrets.json, foo_oauth2.txt, foo_oauth2service.json
    - goo_client_secrets.json, goo_oauth2.txt, goo_oauth2service.json
    - shared_client_secrets.json, shared_oauth2service.json
    - shared1_oauth2.txt, shared2_oauth2.txt

client_secrets.json, oauth2.txt, oauth2service.json, extra_args.txt were copied to their new location
when you initially executed the command: gam select default verify

Copy the prefixed files to GamConfigDir by hand as necessary.

Edit gam.cfg to set up additional clients; it should look like this when complete.

To get information about your main client, don't select a section.
$gam info domain
Google Apps Domain: main.com
Customer ID: 0000000000
...
To get information about another client, select a section.
$gam select foo info domain
Google Apps Domain: foo.com
Customer ID: 1111111111
...
$gam select shared2 info domain
Google Apps Domain: shared2.org
Customer ID: 4444444444
...

Suppose you want to work with foo for a while, then switch to goo but don't want to keep typing gam select.
$gam select foo save
GAM sets section = foo in the DEFAULT section, updates gam.cfg, selects foo for this and subsequent gam commands so you don't have to use select <Section> argument.
$gam info user admin
User: admin@foo.com
...

When it's time to switch to goo, select and save the section.
$gam select goo save
GAM sets section = goo in the DEFAULT section, updates gam.cfg, selects goo for this and subsequent gam commands so you don't have to use select <Section> argument.
$gam info user admin
User: admin@goo.com
...

If you have to switch back to foo for a single command, select foo, but don't save it, further commands without a select will be goo.
$gam select foo info user admin
User: admin@foo.com
...
$gam info user admin
User: admin@goo.com
...

If you have to switch back to main for a single command, select default, but don't save it, further commands without a select will be goo.
$gam select default info user admin
User: admin@main.com
...
$gam info user admin
User: admin@goo.com
...

To use the DEFAULT section as the selected section, i.e., no automatic selection of a section, select default and save
$gam select default save
GAM sets section = DEFAULT in the DEFAULT section, updates gam.cfg, selects DEFAULT for this and subsequent gam commands so you don't have to use select <Section> argument.
$gam info user admin
User: admin@main.com
...

The gam csv command and the select argument can be combined to perform powerful operations in a single command line.

Suppose you have the following CSV file, InfoAdmins.csv:
Section,AdminUser
default,admin
foo,fooadmin
goo,gooadmin
shared1,admin1
shared2,admin2

For each of the domains, you want to get user information about the domain administrator.
$gam csv InfoAdmins.csv gam select ~Section info user "~AdminUser" nolicenses

For each of the domains, you also want to list the Google Drive files for the domain administrator.
$gam csv InfoAdmins.csv gam select ~Section user "~AdminUser" show filelist id

Suppose you have two CSV files, NewFooUsers.csv and NewGooUsers.csv, with the columns: Email,FirstName,LastName,Password.
You will use these files to create new users in the foo.com and goo.com domains.

To process the files sequentially, there are two forms:
$gam select foo save csv NewFooUsers.csv gam create user ~Email firstname ~FirstName lastname ~LastName password ~Password
$gam select goo save csv NewGooUsers.csv gam create user ~Email firstname ~FirstName lastname ~LastName password ~Password
You could also do:
$gam csv NewFooUsers.csv gam select foo create user ~Email firstname ~FirstName lastname ~LastName password ~Password
$gam csv NewGooUsers.csv gam select goo create user ~Email firstname ~FirstName lastname ~LastName password ~Password
In the first form, the select/save before csv sets the default section which then applies to each gam instance.
In the second form, the select is performed for each gam instance.

To process the files in parallel in separate shells, you have to use the second form.
In shell number 1, do:
$gam csv NewFooUsers.csv gam select foo create user ~Email firstname ~FirstName lastname ~LastName password ~Password
In shell number 2, do:
$gam csv NewGooUsers.csv gam select goo create user ~Email firstname ~FirstName lastname ~LastName password ~Password

The gam loop command and the select and redirect arguments can be combined to perform powerful operations in a single command line.

gam loop (-|<FileName>) [charset <CharSet>] [matchfield <FieldName> <PythonRegularExpression>] gam <GAM argument list>

Suppose you have the following CSV file, InfoDomains.csv:
Section,Domain,AdminUser
foo,foo.com,googleadmin
goo,goo.com,admin
shared1,shared1.org,admin1
shared2,shared2.org,admin2

For each of the domains, you want to get user information about the domain administrator. GAM writes this information
to stdout, so you'll redirect stdout. In the first case, you want all of the output in a single file so stdout is
redirected to a file before the loop command.
$gam redirect stdout InfoDomainAdmins.lst append loop InfoDomains.csv gam select ~Section info user "~AdminUser" nolicenses

In the second case, you want the output for each domain administrator in a separate file so stdout is redirected after
the loop command.
$gam loop InfoDomains.csv select ~Section redirect stdout Info-~~Domain~~-Admin.lst info user "~AdminUser" nolicenses

For each of the domains, you also want to list the Google Drive files for the domain administrator. GAM writes this information
to a csv file, so you'll redirect csv output. In the first case, you want all of the output in a single file so csv output is
redirected to a file before the loop command.
$gam redirect csv FilesDomainAdmins.csv append loop InfoDomains.csv gam select ~Section user "~AdminUser" show filelist id

In the second case, you want the output for each domain administrator in a separate file so csv output is redirected after
the loop command.
$gam loop InfoDomains.csv select ~Section redirect csv Files-~~Domain~~-Admin.csv user "~AdminUser" show filelist id
